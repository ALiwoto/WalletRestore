# WalletRestore

A simple automation brute-force solution for restoring a wallet from a seed phrase.

If you have forgotten part of your seed phrases, this tool can help you to recover your wallet.

> NOTE: Since different wallets may use many security measures and extra parameters, there is no guarantee that this tool can recover your wallet. It is just a simple automation tool that I made as a side project in my free time.

## How to run

```bash
./WalletRestore.exe --no-progress --cores:4
```
